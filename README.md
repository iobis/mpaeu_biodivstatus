Here you find the codes used to produce the Deliverable 5.2 of MPA Europe, "Spatial relationship between the measures of biodiversity and environmental conditions".

The underlying data is available in the S3 bucket s3://mpaeu-dist/ and in the Shiny application at [shiny.obis.org/distmaps](https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps). See also [this code](https://github.com/iobis/mpaeu_map_platform/blob/main/scripts/download_aws_model.R) to download the data on R.

The study area shapefile is available on the repository [iobis/mpaeu_studyarea](https://github.com/iobis/mpaeu_studyarea)

Other details (for example, how to obtain the raw data used in the `raw-richness.R` code) are available in the repository [iobis/mpaeu_sdm](https://github.com/iobis/mpaeu_sdm)

NOTE: this is a preliminary analysis.
